# Spring Boot Boilerplate

Spring Boot Boilerplate useful for development speed increasing

## Getting started with Maven

Since Spring Boot requires a dependency manager, I used maven instead of gradle.
For additional information, take a look at the link below
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
For this project, the following command is enough for setup maven:
```
mvn -B archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
  -DgroupId=br.com.bitclouds \
  -DartifactId=spring-boot-boilerplate
```
